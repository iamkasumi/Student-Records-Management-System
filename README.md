### SDG
"Our proposed system is intricately connected to Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8.2), which seeks to 'Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.' Our strategy directly addresses the key components of this goal.

Firstly, by fostering economic diversification, we aim to reduce reliance on a narrow range of industries, thereby contributing to sustained economic growth. Diversification enhances resilience and creates a more stable economic foundation, aligning with the SDG's objective of promoting sustained development.

Secondly, our emphasis on technological upgrading aligns with the goal's call for innovation. By integrating advanced technologies, we strive to enhance productivity across various sectors, ensuring that our economic growth is not only sustained but also technologically progressive.

In summary, our proposed system is designed to achieve higher levels of economic productivity in a manner that aligns with the principles of SDG 8.2, contributing to sustained growth, innovation, and the creation of inclusive and decent employment opportunities."
